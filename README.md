Here is the current attempt at a prompt. It is not finalized:

{
	"query":"Okay, I'm going to give you a task. I want you to respond with a json object with the following fields: subtasks, tips, requiredToolsAndmaterials, estimatedCompletionTime, difficulty, pointValue, urgency, textAssets, costEstimate. Give the estimated completion time as an decimal hour number, not a range. The difficulty and urgency will be on a range of 1-10. The points will correspond to the difficulty, but will be exponential, specifically, it'll be 5^difficulty. For textAssets, you will produce useful text assets for the task (e.g. a template, a list, etc.) Here is the task: Add a page to my website about our SEO services. HERE IS ADDITIONAL INFO ON THE TASK: it is for a company that produces tower products."
